In codee.Driver, I wrote a test to show how to creat a 2D array of a class.
This, I think, is useful in creating and operation the board.
In this test, I creat a 7*7 array, .
OppositeDirectionTile[][] TwoDarray = new OppositeDirectionTile[7][7];
[0,0]	[1,0]	[2,0]	[3,0]	[4,0]	[5,0]	[6,0]
[0,1]	[1,1]	[2,1]	[3,1]	[4,1]	[5,1]	[6,1]
[0,2]	[1,2]	[2,2]	[3,2]	[4,2]	[5,2]	[6,2]
[0,3]	[1,3]	[2,3]	[3,3]	[4,3]	[5,3]	[6,3]
[0,4]	[1,4]	[2,4]	[3,4]	[4,4]	[5,4]	[6,4]
[0,5]	[1,5]	[2,5]	[3,5]	[4,5]	[5,5]	[6,5]
[0,6]	[1,6]	[2,6]	[3,6]	[4,6]	[5,6]	[6,6]
[0,7]	[1,7]	[2,7]	[3,7]	[4,7]	[5,7]	[6,7]


to use a 2D array, for example, visit TileNum in method of row2 column 3, just type TwoDarray[1][2].TileNum, then you can use it. 
If you have any question about how the 2D array works, email me.
